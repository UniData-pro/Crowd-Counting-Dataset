# Crowd Density Dataset - Different Crowd Sizes

The dataset consists of **647** images of crowds, containing up to **11,000** individuals, annotated with **keypoints** for precise crowd counting and density estimation. It is designed for crowd counting tasks, particularly in crowded scenes settings, accommodating various sizes and challenges in estimating density. The dataset includes examples of both denser crowds and sparser crowds, enhancing counting accuracy for real-world applications in crowd analysis - **[Get the data](https://unidata.pro/datasets/people-detection-image?utm_source=github&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=crowds)**
